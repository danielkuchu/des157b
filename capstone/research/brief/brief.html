    <h1>Capstone Project Brief</h1>
    <h2>Daniel Ramos</h2>
    
    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
    <p>In our final project, we aim to explore 5-10 symbols from the Seal, sharing their significance and background with our audience of 18-23 year-olds. We want users to connect with these symbols through a quick assessment, allowing them to see how their interpretations compare to other Davis users.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <p>Our primary goal for this project is to generate interest and intrigue in Davis from a young adult audience. Our secondary goal is to collect data from our audience to see what Davis means to them. Another goal we want to highlight in this project is showing appreciation for Susan Shelton and allowing her to speak for her work and how she intended to portray certain symbols. 
    </p>

    <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
    <p>In terms of visual design, we plan on having a clean interface that highlights high-resolution images of the seal and also organizes previous user data in a way that’s fascinating and interesting to read for a new user. We want the page to first open up with instructions / background on why users should even interact with the seal in this way, and from there they would be presented each symbol one by one and will be given a prompt similar to that of “What’s the first word that comes to mind when you see this symbol?”, or “Describe how you feel when looking at this panel in 5 words”. We want the question pages to be quite minimal in appearance, with just the question, input field, symbol image, and maybe a timer to let the user think of their response freely. </p>

    <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
    <p>Initially, the user will be given the opportunity to examine a high-definition photo of the Seal along with information about each symbol/panel. Then,  we plan on allowing the users to complete a symbol analysis form. They will be timed on giving a short analysis of a few symbols from the Seal. After they finish their form, their short answers will be compared with others. Afterwards, they are prompted to see Susan’s intention behind the symbol and what it means to her.</p>

    <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
    <p>The main goal that we have for our users’ experiences is for them to gain a better understanding of the city of Davis and everything that makes up the community. Their responses will contribute to a collection of data that allows us to see how UC Davis students interpret their experience in Davis. </p>

    <h3>Target Users</h3>
    <p>Our target audience is specifically 18-23 year old UC Davis students who have an interest in learning more about where they are and how they can fit into a community. College often represents a time of rapid personal, emotional, and intellectual growth for most students, so we wanted to curate an experience where users can reflect on their own emotions and hopefully find belonging in the community around them.</p>

    <h3>Partner Dynamic</h3>
    <p>For the first 1-2 weeks, we plan on collaborating on the ideation of the questions and selection of the symbols by meeting with Susan Shelton herself. From there, we will then both work on / agree upon the overall visual design of the website. From there, one of us can focus on the HTML / CSS structuring of the site, while the other can test data collection and data visualization in JSON and JavaScript. </p>

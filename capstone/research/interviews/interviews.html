<h2>Interviews Summarized</h2>
 <p>All togehter, we would like to thank Samar, Michelle, Sadeed, and Cindy for participating in our interviews. These four individuals are all students at UC Davis, ranging from first to fifth year students. We gained a lot of valuable information that confirmed and debunked a few assumptions we had about interactive elements in public places and how fond students are of Davis. </p>
 <p>We learned that UC Davis students do go downtown often, but they are not necessarily intentional with experiencing the world around them. They usually just have one goal, whether it's getting boba at iTea or a snack at Honeydew, they tend to get what they need and return to their lives as students. This concerned our team, since we are planning to use QR codes in public places within the downtown Davis area to attract interest in the Seal. Though, a few solutions were suggested within this process. </p>
 <p>From our interviews, the students made it very clear that a marketing strategy is needed in order to gain some kind of traction, aside from the QR codes near/next to the Seal. So, we believe that bringing the QR code along with some kind of poster and posting it around popular eateries or monuments in Davis would surely drive more interest. Also, having an Instagram or TikTok would help us reach the wider audience of Davis that lives further away from downtown. By doing this, we can teach about the things that make Davis unique and loveable in a way that speaks to our ALL of our audience.</p>

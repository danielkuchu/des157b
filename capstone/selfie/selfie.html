    <p>What I like most about the seal is the agriculture and the geography displayed. These two topics remind me heavily of my time at UC Davis and the area surrounding us. I will never forget the random sightings that I would have of various species of animals doing funny things. Davis embraces the nature around it instead of trying to push it out. That is why I love Davis so much.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>How easy was it for you to navigate through the quiz app?</li>
        <p>The hierarchy was solid, which helped the user know what was important and what wasn't. Maybe if the instructions popped up first, then we wouldn't have to sacrifice the size of the font. Maybe have it be opened by an information icon.</p>
        <li>Did you find the instructions provided clear and concise?</li>
        <p>The instructions were a little small, which made understanding the interface a little more difficult.</p>
        <li>Were the answer options easy to read and understand?</li>
        <p>The user did not struggle with the answer options.</p>
        <li>How satisfied were you with the visual design and layout of the quiz app?</li>
        <p>Add captions to the images to give the user some context.</p>
        <li>Were the feedback or result screens informative and helpful?</li>
        <p>The figma file actually helped the user visualize what we were aiming for, which they appreciated, but we just have to work on implementing the code.</p>
